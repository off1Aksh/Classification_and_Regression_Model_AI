# AI Final Project: Regression and Classification Models

This repository contains the implementation of two major topics from an **Artificial Intelligence** course:
1. **Regression Model**
2. **Classification Model**

Each model is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook using Python and libraries such as *scikit-learn*, *matplotlib*, and *pandas*. The project showcases the complete pipeline—from data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, to visualization.

## 📂 File Structure

- `Regresi.ipynb` — Notebook implementing linear regression, including data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization.
- `klasifikasi.ipynb` — Notebook implementing classification models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree, along with evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy scores.
- `Noodle1uu.csv` — Classification Dataset
- `Mobile phone price.csv` — Regression Dataset
